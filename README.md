# POSTMAN
*Postman is an API client that makes it easy for developers to create, share, test and document APIs. With this open-source API testing tool, users can create and save simple and complex HTTP/s requests, as well as read their responses.*
## GET
GET is used to request data from a specified resource. 

## POST
POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
The data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the HTTP request

## PUT
PUT method is used to update resource available on the server. Typically, it replaces whatever exists at the target URL with something else. You can use it to make a new resource or overwrite an existing one. PUT requests that the enclosed entity must be stored under the supplied requested URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).

## PATCH 
PATCH is a method of modifying resources where the client sends partial data that is to be updated without modifying the entire data. HTTP PATCH is basically said to be non-idempotent. So if you retry the request N times, you will end up having N resources with N different URIs created on the server.
